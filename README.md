# booknotes-myFirstDjangoProject
This repository contains source code for a Django based website to store and share your book notes.  
(You can visit the website <a href="http://srinidhikbhat.pythonanywhere.com/">here</a>)  
The design is largely inspired from <a href="https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer">Corey Schafer</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p">Django YouTube tutorial.</a>

**In this website:**  
- You can Register and Login to the website.
- You can view the books and respective booknotes added by other users.
- You can add a book you read, along with your notes to share with everyone.
- You can see a 'Quote of the Day' sidebar which will refresh with a new quote everyday.

**Improvements yet to be made:**  
- Support 'Forgot password' option.
- Make UI improvements to view the posts as thumbnails.
- Add the 'Date Read' section for the Book detail view.
- Remove the 'Pages' attribure from the Book detail view.
